Previous Task: Prototype the "process index" fetcher by displaying it a list display of any kind within a tab widget there by also prototyping our UI for when the application runs.
Ideally the ListWidget will be used to prototype and test our process index fetching algorithm. The final product will use a ListView widget as we'll want to display percentage bars application icons and it needs to be done on loop which in itself makes the ListWidget unfeasible for this operation.




Current Tasks:
Application names can be found using the system command "cat /proc/[PID]/comm"
Lets try and use this to our advantage. 

Notes/Hints



Other Thoughts:

Do you want the application name with or without the file suffix? (i.e. Firefox instead of Firefox.exe). One option is to use strtok but strtok is old and does modern C++ already have an improved version?



Final Thoughts:

Stuff like finding app names, ram usage, cpu usage should be done in the one class called the "process algorithms"
